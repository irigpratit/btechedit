    <b><p>Bachelor of Technical Education in Information Technology</p></b>
    <p>Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) has been one of the prominent sectors globally for a long. Dewey (1916) saw TVET as a tool for education reform in modernizing society. This has been equally vibrant in the present context as scholars (e.g. Maclean & Wilson, 2009) argue that TVET is an education and training that prepares an individual for gainful employment. TVET programs equip young people with the skills, knowledge, and competencies required to enter a particular type of professional career (OECD 2017). Hence, the role of TVET in preparing skilled human resources and enabling them to transition into the career path for gainful employment in specific and the country's economic development in a broad is inevitable.

Bachelor's of Technical Education in Information Technology is a program designed for the students who has a Minimum D+ grade in each subject of grade 12 with CGPA 1.8 or more or a minimum score of second division marks in 10+2, PCL or equivalent in any disciplines and have background knowledge of Information Technology or Computer.
